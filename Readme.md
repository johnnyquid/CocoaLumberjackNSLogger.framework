CocoaLumberjack NSLogger Bridge
===============================

Framework that integrates [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaLumberjack) and [NSLogger](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger) using the [bridge](https://github.com/steipete/NSLogger-CocoaLumberjack-connector) developed by steipete. 

The framework is aimed to be easy to integrated into iOS projects. Instead of copying the source files of the 3 projects, now you can add the framework as a git submodule and link your project to it.
